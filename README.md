# trivialOS
Operating Systems Spring 2019 

To illustrate that an os from a very simplistic viewpoint is a collection of functions (system calls), we used assembly and 
c to create a few functions that perform very simple tasks, then compiled the files containing these functions into a disk image,
which we then loaded into Oracle Virtual Box and ran as a trivial operating system.
